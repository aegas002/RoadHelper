This is an pending project until i graduate 

Idea of the project:
To have an on-board minitype projector display system. A signal processing module (SAMN Board) receives
and processes image signals sent by a control terminal, and outputs the image signals to a laser head. 
The laser light source is subjected to multiple times of reflection until it reaches the windshield. The 
windshield has a semipermeable reflection membrane which is located anywhere the driver places it. 

Currently designing projection board, reflection ratios, casing, and logic. 
***Hoping for a working prototype by mid July 2019***
